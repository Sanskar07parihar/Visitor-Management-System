# Visitor-Management-System
The visitor management system is used in recording the details of customers, parks and rides. For example: Sanskar is visiting wonderland and taking enjoying sone rides so all the record is going to be stored in this system. It helps the management of parks to track the records of rides and parks that customers visited.
